//!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//BASIC INSTRUCTIONS - READ THEM CAREFULLY
//!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//0) Work in notepad (don't use Word!).
//1) Always leave capitals/caps locks as they are (example 1: LATEST NEWS, translate it and leave all letters big; example 2: if it says Player, then translate and leave the first letter big!).
//2) Always leave variables as they are (for example: $langmark226 must always remain the same, don't change it!).
//3) Always leave punctation as it is, if there is no full stop at the end of the scentence, don't add it, if there is one, don't remove it!
//4) Same goes for quotes (example: "translation") that must stay at the start and at the end of each expression.
//5) Try to find words with similar lenght (especially try to avoid translating very short words with very long expressions!).
//6) Some expressions are commented (for example "//stands for points") - leave comments untranslated
//7) When you are unsure about certain word/expression, always consult other translators!
//8) Be very precise to avoid grammatical errors!
//9) Try to check on Basketsim the page you are currently translating (for example players page). This will make translations better!
//10) If you don't understand these instructions consult other translators.
//Thanks for the effort!
